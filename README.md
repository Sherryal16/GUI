# ActionListener Example in Java
This Java program demonstrates the use of the `ActionListener` interface in GUI programming, particularly with the Swing library. The program creates a simple graphical user interface with a button, and when the button is clicked, it triggers an action through the `ActionListener`.

## Understanding ActionListener

### Overview

`ActionListener` is an interface in Java used for handling events generated by user actions, particularly in GUI programming.

### Purpose

- Respond to user actions on interactive components (e.g., buttons, menu items).
- Execute specific actions when these components are activated or clicked.

### How it Works

1. **Implementation:**
   - Implement the `actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)` method.

2. **Registration:**
   - Register the `ActionListener` with the component that generates the action.



3. **Event Handling:**
   - When the registered component is interacted with, the `actionPerformed` method is invoked, executing the specified code.

## Usage

- Run the program and a simple GUI window will appear.
- Click the "Click Me" button to trigger the ActionListener and display a message.
